    <h2>What is a Croissant?</h2>
    <p>
      A croissant is crescent shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough. 
    </br>    
      The dough is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded several times in
      a process called lamination. 
       </br> 
      The final dough is cut into triangles and
      rolled into a crescent shape.The process of lamination results in a
      layered, flaky textured roll, more like puff pastry.
